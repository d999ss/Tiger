## 🎯 Complete the Installation

### You should see a Python installer window. Follow these steps:

1. **Click "Continue"** on the introduction screen
2. **Click "Continue"** on the Read Me
3. **Click "Continue"** on the License
4. **Click "Agree"** to accept the license

## ⚡ After Installation - Run This Command

Once the Python installer is complete, run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/donnysmith/Desktop/Tiger CMS/vibetest-use"
./complete-setup.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Create virtual environment with Python 3.11
- ✅ Install Vibetest and all dependencies
- ✅ Install Playwright browser
- ✅ Show you the MCP configuration to paste into Cursor

**The automated setup takes about 2-3 minutes.**

## 🔍 Verify Python Installation

After the installer finishes, you can verify it worked:

```bash
python3.11 --version
# Should show: Python 3.11.9

which python3.11
# Should show: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11
```

---

## 🚀 Full Setup Commands (Copy & Paste)

```bash
# 1. Verify Python installed
python3.11 --version

# 2. Run automated Vibetest setup
cd "/Users/donnysmith/Desktop/Tiger CMS/vibetest-use"
./complete-setup.sh

# 3. Configure Cursor with the MCP settings shown
# (The setup script will display the exact config to copy)

# 4. Restart Cursor

# 5. Start testing!
cd "/Users/donnysmith/Desktop/Tiger CMS"
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then in Cursor: "Vibetest localhost:8000 with 5 agents"
```

---

## ❓ If the Installer Didn't Open

```bash
# Manually open it:
open /tmp/python3.11.pkg

# Or re-download if needed:
cd /tmp
curl -o python3.11.pkg https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-macos11.pkg
open python3.11.pkg
```

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Install Homebrew First (Optional)

If you want to use Homebrew for easier package management in the future:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (you'll need to enter your password)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Python via Homebrew
brew install python@3.11

# Continue with setup
cd "/Users/donnysmith/Desktop/Tiger CMS/vibetest-use"
./complete-setup.sh
```
