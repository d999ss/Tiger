## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Input validation
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  return input.replace(/[<>]/g, '');
}

// ‚ùå Bad: No validation
function processInput(input) {
  element.innerHTML = input; // XSS vulnerability
}
```

#### Key Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries (if using databases)

2. **Output Encoding**
   - Encode data before displaying
   - Use appropriate encoding for context (HTML, JavaScript, URL)

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use secure password handling
   - Enable MFA where possible

4. **Sensitive Data**
   - Never commit secrets to repository
   - Use environment variables
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

5. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly audit for known vulnerabilities
   - Remove unused dependencies

6. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive info in error messages
   - Log errors securely
   - Fail securely (deny by default)

### For Content Editors

1. **File Uploads**
   - Only upload files from trusted sources
   - Verify file types before uploading
   - Scan files for malware

2. **External Links**
   - Verify links before adding them
   - Use HTTPS for all external resources
   - Be cautious with third-party scripts

3. **User Data**
   - Follow GDPR and HIPAA guidelines
   - Only collect necessary information
   - Secure user data appropriately
