            <h2>Scientific Foundation</h2>
            <p>Our approach to {topic} is built on rigorous scientific principles and comprehensive understanding of tissue biology. We combine fundamental research with applied science to develop practical solutions that address clinical challenges.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Biological Understanding:</strong> Deep knowledge of tissue architecture, cellular behavior, and healing mechanisms informs our product development. We study how tissues respond to injury, how healing progresses, and what factors optimize outcomes. This biological foundation ensures our products work in harmony with natural healing processes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Material Science:</strong> Advanced biomaterial engineering creates products with optimal physical and biological properties. We carefully select and process materials to achieve the right balance of strength, flexibility, porosity, and biocompatibility. Material properties are tailored to specific applications and clinical requirements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Clinical Translation:</strong> Bridging the gap between laboratory research and clinical application requires careful validation and testing. We conduct extensive preclinical studies followed by well-designed clinical trials. This systematic approach ensures safety and efficacy before products reach patients.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Quality Science:</strong> Scientific rigor extends to our quality systems and manufacturing processes. We apply scientific methods to validate processes, establish specifications, and ensure consistent quality. Every product batch meets stringent quality criteria based on scientific testing.</p>
