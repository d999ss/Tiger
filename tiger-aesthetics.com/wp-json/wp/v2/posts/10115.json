It cannot be solved with topical treatments, yet $3 billion is spent each year on cellulite creams and gadgets that don&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>Tiger Aesthetics has developed the first and only cellulite treatment that allows a provider to identify and release the major underlying cause of cellulite and confirm the release in real time. <a href=\"https:\/\/myaveli.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Av\u00e9li<sup><small>\u00ae<\/small><\/sup><\/a> is an FDA-cleared, minimally invasive treatment clinically shown in a 12-month observational study to deliver lasting reduction in cellulite on the buttocks and thighs in a single in-office procedure that takes about an hour with local numbing and little to no downtime<sup><small>5,6<\/small><\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>The treatment is available in more than 700 aesthetic practices nationwide and has a ~90% RealSelf &#8220;worth it&#8221; rating<sup><small>7<\/small><\/sup>.
