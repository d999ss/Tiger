This acquisition broadens the commercial impact of the Tiger Aesthetics portfolio into the fast-growing field of regenerative body aesthetics.<\/p>\n<p>Cellulite is one of the most common skin conditions worldwide, yet practitioners have struggled effectively to address the primary underlying cause. The Av\u00e9li device is the only single-use disposable device that enables visualization and targeted release of the specific septa causing the cellulite dimples. The minimally-invasive procedure is performed in-office under local anesthesia and can be administered by both licensed and trained physicians, as well as mid-level providers in many states.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are focused on enabling our customers to differentiate and enhance their practices through innovative new procedures inside and outside of the operating room,&#8221; said Oliver Burckhardt, Co-CEO of Tiger BioSciences. &#8220;Av\u00e9li is the perfect fit to help our customers deliver great results in an area of fast-growing and significant patient need, namely body aesthetics, and complements our rapidly expanding portfolio of products for regenerative aesthetics perfectly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lower body rejuvenation is a rapidly growing area of unmet need amongst aesthetic consumers, with key concerns including cellulite, volume deficiency or reduction, and loose skin. With the Revelle acquisition, Tiger will be able to provide customers with a comprehensive and differentiated suite of combination options for lower body rejuvenation, inclusive of Av\u00e9li for cellulite, Viality\u2122 for enhanced viability fat transfer, and the forthcoming alloCLAE\u2122 and dermaCLAE\u2122 structural adipose fillers to augment volume in aesthetic body procedures.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For far too long, millions of women have struggled to feel comfortable in their own skin because of their cellulite and have been settling for less than effective treatment options,&#8221; said Caroline Van Hove, CEO of Revelle Aesthetics. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to see Tiger Aesthetics build and lead this market and make the Av\u00e9li procedure available to more patients and practices.
