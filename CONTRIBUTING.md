## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] Git installed and configured
- [ ] Access to the Tiger GitHub repository
- [ ] Python 3.8+ (for QA tools)
- [ ] Node.js 16+ (for build tools)
- [ ] A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d999ss/Tiger.git
   cd Tiger
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   # Install QA dependencies
   cd qa-automation
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

---

## üíª Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type and purpose of changes:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Urgent production fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or updates

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-new-product-page`
- `fix/navigation-mobile-bug`
- `docs/update-qa-guide`
- `refactor/optimize-images`

### Making Changes

1. **Work on your feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make incremental commits** (commit early and often)

3. **Keep your branch updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. **Test your changes thoroughly** (see Testing Requirements)

## üìù Coding Standards

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include descriptive `alt` attributes for images
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels where appropriate)
- Validate HTML with W3C validator

**Example:**
```html
<section class="product-info">
  <h2>Product Name</h2>
  <img src="product.jpg" alt="Detailed description of product">
  <p>Product description goes here.</p>
</section>
```

### CSS

- Use meaningful class names (BEM methodology preferred)
- Organize properties logically
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Use CSS variables for colors and repeated values
- Optimize for performance (avoid expensive selectors)

**Example:**
```css
.product-card {
  display: flex;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

.product-card__title {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

### JavaScript

- Use `const` and `let` (avoid `var`)
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Optimize for performance

**Example:**
```javascript
// Fetch product data from API
async function fetchProductData(productId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${productId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch product:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Python (QA Scripts)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Handle exceptions properly

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting

All changes must be tested using our QA automation suite:

```bash
cd qa-automation

# Run full test suite
./run-qa.sh

# Or run specific tests
python browser_qa.py       # Browser compatibility
python visual_qa.py        # Visual regression
python check_assets.py     # Asset verification
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [ ] Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Check images load properly
- [ ] Test forms and user interactions
- [ ] Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] Check page load performance

### Test Coverage

- Write tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying features
- Ensure tests are reproducible

---

## üìù Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:

```
Type: Brief description (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed (wrap at 72 chars).
Explain what changed and why, not how.

- Bullet points are okay
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
```

### Commit Types

- **Add:** New feature or file
- **Update:** Modify existing functionality
- **Fix:** Bug fix
- **Remove:** Delete code or files
- **Refactor:** Code restructuring without changing functionality
- **Docs:** Documentation changes
- **Style:** Formatting, whitespace (no code change)
- **Test:** Add or update tests
- **Chore:** Maintenance tasks

### Examples

**Good commits:**
```
Add: Product comparison table to Tiger Aesthetics

Implement a responsive comparison table showing key features
across the regenerative aesthetics product line.
```

```
Fix: Navigation dropdown not closing on mobile

Resolved issue where mobile menu remained open after selection.
Added event listener to close menu on item click.
```

**Bad commits:**
```
fixed stuff          # Too vague
WIP                  # Work in progress - shouldn't be pushed
asdfasdf            # Meaningless
```
